Features that has been added to my ReactJS project (at least recently, will update it ASAP):
1. Navigation bar
2. Overlay Section
3. Carousel
4. Modals
5. Input form with validation events
6. (Newest 14/06/24) Todo List update using React Hook
   
Brief explaination about ToDo List features:
In making ToDo List component, we have to add a new jsx file named TodoList.jsx. In that file, we have to stating useState so that we can save the Todo List data, after that add useEffect to show alert "Selamat Datang" while mounting and "Sampai jumpa" when the components is unmount. Add totalTask to start counting all of the tasks and it would be resets if the task is already done or delete. The total task is saved in useState.
